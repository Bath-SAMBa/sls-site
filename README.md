How to edit this site locally:

1.  Download Quarto from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
2.  Pull the repository
3.  Open the "website.Rproj" file in R-Studio. Edit the "sls.qmd" file (this is the SLS schedule) as appropriate. In R-studio this is very easy: it's an intuitive GUI
4.  Render the website, all outputted html and css is shoved into the "/docs" folder. There is a button for this in R-studio: top right window got to the build tab, click "Render Website". Pressing this button will also open a preview of the website.
5.  Push the freshly rendered website to GitHub. Should update within an hour.
